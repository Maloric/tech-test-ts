# About

The goal of this repo is to test the developer's basic knowledge of Typescript, Promises and testing.

Open ./src/movieService.ts and implement the "getMovieStars" function such that:

-   it returns the top 5 movie stars for a given genre (e.g. Comedy)
-   it only returns stars whose movies were release since the provided year
-   the stars are ordered by an "average_rating" property, based on the ratings for each movie in the data service

## Stretch goal

Implement unit tests for the code you have written.
